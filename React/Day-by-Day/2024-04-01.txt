# Assignment:
After revision, try to create one state which has true & false value,
if the value is true then you will show full name else full name will be hidden.
Also, it consist a button to toggle the true/false value.


# Two types of data a React component can have:
 i] Props: Properties (Data from Parent component to child component)
ii] State: State (Data owned by the component)

> React support only one way Data binding. (Parent ---> Child)

# Destructuring Object:

const studentDetails = {
    firstName: 'Rahul',
    lastName: 'Dravid'
}

const {firstName, lastName} = studentDetails;

> A component re-renders whenever any of the two values change: State or Props


# Hooks: Simple function of React to perform tasks efficiently.

- useState (Creation of states in React components)

- Before introduction of hooks: State could only be created in class based components.
- After hooks was introduced: State could be created in function based component, new you could create create a React application with all function based components.

> To use hooks, we need to 'import {useState} from React'

> syntax:
const [state, stateHandler] = useState(defaultValue);
> eg.,
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Abhi');
