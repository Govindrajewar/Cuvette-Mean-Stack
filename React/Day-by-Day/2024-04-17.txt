# Steps to create a React-Redux Application:
1. Develop React App
2. SetUp Redux
3. React Redux Configuration(Provider)
4. Subscribe component to redux
5. Dispatch actions


# Folder Structure:
    - components
    - store
    - actions
        - count.js  (contains action creators)
    - reducer
        - count.js (contains reducer functions)


# Combine multiple reducers:
import { combineReducer } from 'redux';

const reducers = combineReducer({
    countReducer: countReducer,
    showReducer: showReducer
})


# Action type constants:
export const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT'

import { INCREMENT } from '../actions/count'
