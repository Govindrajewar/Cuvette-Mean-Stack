    - has Global Scope.
    - can be re-declared.
    - can be re-assigned.

2. let:
    - has local/block Scope.
    - can not be re-declared.
    - can be re-assigned.

3. const:
    - has local/block Scope.
    - can not be re-declared.
    - can not be re-assigned.


# Self invoking function:
(function sayHi(){
    console.log("Hii");
}) ();


# Closure: Inner function continues to have access to outer function variable even after outer function have executed.
eg.,
    let outer = function (){
        let x = 10;
        let inner = function (){
            console.log(x);
        }
        return inner;
    }

    let def = outer();
    def();          // output: 10


# Arrow function:
eg.,
Way 1:
    let sum = (a, b) => {
        return a + b;
    }
    console.log(sum(10, 20));

Way 2:
    let sum = (a, b) => a+b;
    console.log(sum(10, 20));
